# Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm Implementation

This project contains an implementation of Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm using Python and the NetworkX library.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed Python 3.x
* You have installed the NetworkX library. If not, you can install it using pip:
  
```
  pip install networkx
  ```


## Running the Test Drivers

To run the test drivers, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal/command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python script.
3. Run the Python script using the following command:
   
```
   python lab3.py
   ```


If the implementation of Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm is correct, the script will run without raising any exceptions. I have added a test passed message to the end of the script. If you see this message, the test drivers have passed successfully.
