# Sorting Algorithms Test Drivers

This repository contains test drivers for various sorting algorithms implemented in the 'sorting.ipynb' Jupyter Notebook. Follow the steps below to get the test drivers running.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib (for visualizing the sorting algorithms at end of the notebook)
- Or use google colab - https://colab.research.google.com/ - in the setup step upload the notebook and run the code simply

## Installation / Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Download and install Python 3.x from the official website.
3. Install Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   pip install jupyter
   ```
4. Install Matplotlib by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
    pip install matplotlib
   ```
5. Open the 'sorting.ipynb' notebook in Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab or Google Colab.

## Running the Test Drivers

1. Run the code cells containing the sorting algorithms one by one in the notebook.
2. Locate the section in the notebook where the test driver is commented.
4. Run the test driver code cell.
