# Chained Hash Table in Python
This module implements a Hash table with chained hashing in Python.

## Usage
Import the HashTable class from this module.
Create an instance of the HashTable class.
Use the methods provided by the HashTable class to interact with the hash table.
```
from hashtable import HashTable

# Create a hash table
hash_table = HashTable(size=5) 

# Insert a key-value pair  
hash_table.insert('key', 'value')

# Retrieve a value by key
value = hash_table.get('key')

# Remove a key-value pair
hash_table.remove('key') 

# Check if a key exists in the hash table
exists = hash_table.contains('key')
```


# Test Drivers

This module includes test drivers to verify the correctness of the implementation. To run the test drivers, follow these steps:

Ensure that Python is installed on your system.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the 'hashtable.py' file is located.
Run the following command: `python -m unittest test_hashtable.py`
The test drivers will execute and display the results of the tests.

Note: The 'test_hashtable.py' file should be in the same directory as the 'hashtable.py' file.
